-make sure matching is correct for new spring15 sample. 
-Make sure using uptodate WP (medium) -- just need to fix the neutral hadron
barrel somehow.
-Apply selection --- only Zmass veto to do
-contact Ming regarding 8 TeV DY sample
-Plot fake rate vs pT, eta, N_trks, PU, etc --- having trouble plotting normal
branches - variables are TBranchElements.
-Do I consider just barrel, or endcaps as well? ---both but separately. Still
plot for full detector
-make better set-up with a photon collection and include an N-1 selection for
all cuts


Event Selection
- > 2 photons
- medium working point selection
- matching
- within Z-mass range 60-120 GeV
- Passes Conversion Veto

Fake Rate (efficiency)
- To get efficiency (FR), compute signal (passes all cuts including conversion veto) divided by passes selection without conversion veto
